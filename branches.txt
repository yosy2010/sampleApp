###Branches

used to add changes to another copy of the project other than the original one


for example: if you're working on a log in page, you don't want to commit all your changes to the main repository untill you finished the whole thing
so you will start a new branch and commit to it and do whatever you want to that branch and treat it as a different project until you finish it all then you can add it to the wholw main project
